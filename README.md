I have an old Creative Nomad Jukebox MP3 player.  It still works, but I
can't easily change or retrieve the contents -- the software for this
doesn't work with modern operating systems, and is hard to find.  There is a
program for linux and macOS that is supposed to interface with the device,
but it's really slow and wasn't reliable for me.
 
This is a quick and dirty program to read song data from a disk image from a
Creative Nomad Jukebox MP3 player.  To use it, follow these steps:

1. Compile the program.
2. Create a directory named jukebox-out.
3. Create a disk image by removing the hard disk, and attaching it to a
   computer.  Use dd or your favorite disk imaging program to create an
   image of the disk.
4. Name your disk image jukebox.img.
5. Run the program.
6. Your songs have been placed in the jukebox-out directory.

If you don't understand any of the directions above, this program is not for
you.  Questions about how to compile or run the program will be ignored.
This program should compile and run on most UNIX and UNIX-like systems,
including Linux and macOS.  It can probably be compiled on Windows, with
Visual Studio, but the use of cygwin or mingw would be easier.

The program displays a lot of information as it reads the disk image, mainly
for trouble-shooting purposes.  If you've added and deleted songs frequently
from the device, you'll probably notice more output than if you've only used
it a little.

Because the program makes no attempt to understand which songs may have been
deleted, it might recover more than you expect, but be aware that some of
that "more than you expect" is probably corrupted.

YMMV! The program worked to let me recover songs from my MP3 player, but it
might fail miserably for you.

WARNING: Removing the hard disk from the MP3 player will void the MP3
player's warranty!
